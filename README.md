i have always wanted to be a hacker. to be hacky. daring, unapologetic, creative, artsy, and a little nerdy. 

low-level programming excites me.

i love doing hard things even though i do not do them all the time --0r as much as i would love to. 

i believe in FLOSS --so much. i am here, on the internet, to learn and make helpful contributions --'or be contributed to' where I/YOU can. 

i will leave it someday. but for now, here, I am.
