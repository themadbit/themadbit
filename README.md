I have always wanted to be a hacker. To be hacky. Daring, unapologetic, creative, artsy, and a little nerdy. I have a computer science degree, and low-level programming excites me.
I love doing hard things even though I do not do them all the time. Or as much as I would love to. I believe in FLOSS. So much. I am here, on the internet, to learn and make helpful
contributions where I can. I will leave it someday. But for now, here, I am.
